Library and CLI to work with the ETH keystore file:
1. Parse the private key using the keystore password
2. Use the private key to get shares for operators
3. Build the payload for the transaction

## OPTION 1: Running an Executable (Recommended route)

If you want to run a compiled version (easier option then CLI)

1. Go to the releases section: https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv-keys/releases
2. Select the latest release for the specific version of the CLI: `vX.Y.Z-v1` - for the first version of the contract, `vX.Y.Z-v2` - for second etc.
   Example: `v0.0.1-v1` or `v0.0.1-v2`.
3. Download the native executable for your operating system:
   * `ssv-keys-lin` - for Ubuntu Linux
   * `ssv-keys-mac` - for MacOS
   * `ssv-keys.exe` - for Windows
4. Open terminal and change the directory to where you downloaded the executable. For instance, on MacOS you can:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
5. (Mac and Linux) Make sure that the executable has permissions to run by running:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 ./ssv-keys-mac
   ```
6. Now you can run it:
   ```bash
   ./ssv-keys-mac
   ```
7. If your operating system prevents you from running the executable you can open it from the file manager (Finder in case of MacOS), right click on it, and click the `Open` menu. Once open click the `Open` or `allow` button when you are asked to do so. After this go back to the console and try to run it again.

## Option 2: Running from the CLI

### Running from repository

- For regular CLI usage you will be running the command as: `yarn cli ...`
- Follow [installation](#Installation) instructions.



### Help

Help on available actions:

```bash
yarn cli --help
```

Help on a specific action:

```bash
yarn cli <action> --help
```


### Example

#### Step 1: Build the shares:

**Input parameters:**

- keystore (ks) = Path to keystore json file
- password (ps) = Keystore password
- operators (op) = Comma-separated list of the operator keys
- optput-format (of) = Format of the result (abi or raw)

```bash
yarn cli shares --keystore=src/lib/EthereumKeyStore/__tests__/test.keystore.json --password=testtest --operators=0x123,0x234,0x345,0x456 --output-format=raw
```

**Output:**  Shares and path to file holding the shares

#### Step 2: Build the transaction payload:

**Input parameters:**

- keystore (ks) = Path to keystore json file
- password (ps) = Keystore password
- operators (op) = Comma-separated list of the operator keys
- operator-ids (oid) = Comma-separated list of the operator ids (same sequence as operators)
- token-amount (ta) = Token amount fee required for this transaction in Wei

```bash
yarn cli shares --private-key=... -op=...,...,...,... --output=./shares.json
```

**Output:** Transaction payload and path to file holding the transaction payload

#### Step 3: Build and ouput the transaction payload:
**Input parameters:**
- operators-ids = 4 comma seperated operator ids (should match 4 the operators used in step 2)
- private-key = private key output from step 1
- token-amount = yearly fee in wei
- shares = path to shares json file
- output = transaction payload text file location

```bash
yarn cli transaction --operators-ids=1,2,3,4 --private-key=... --token-amount=1234567890 --shares=./shares.json --output=./payload.txt
```

**Output:**  Transaction payload

## Integration in your projects

### Node Project

To run an example of a NodeJS project containing all the code snippets to build the share and transaction payload, simply follow these instructions!

```bash
cd examples/node
yarn install
```

To run a JavaScript example:

```bash
yarn start:js
```

To run a TypeScript example:

```bash
yarn start:ts
```

### Browser project (web application)

Go to the example folder and then install all the dependencies:

```bash
cd examples/browser
yarn install
```

Start the web app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Open the developer console to see how it works in a browser environment.

## Development

### Run the CLI as a TypeScript executable:

```bash
yarn dev:cli ...
```

### Run the CLI as a JavaScript compiled executable:

```bash
yarn cli ...
```

### Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

In watch mode during development

```bash
yarn test --watchAll
```

### Building

Build TypeScript into JavaScript

```bash
yarn build
```

Build for NodeJs using `esbuild`

```bash
yarn esbuild
```

Build everything

```bash
yarn build-all
```

## TODO

* Make it possible to use a specific number of signers (Currently with a default of 4).
